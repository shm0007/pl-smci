<p>Scenario:  Once a day in ancient Italy, Julius Caesar uses a human messenger to order his soldiers one of eight different orders: "Attack", "Defend", "Retreat", "Go North", "Go South", "Go East", or "Go West", or "Hold". He doesn't want his enemies to be able to read the orders if the messenger is captured, so he invents his own encryption algorithm that encrypts the day's order using a number between one and 1000 as a key. He then created a table listing 1000 different kinds of weather that regularly occur in Italy. Each type of weather combined with temperature (e.g., clear skies, sunny, foggy, slightly cloudy, rainy, sunny and foggy, snowy, etc.) is assigned a number between one and 1000. Each day, Caesar and his generals check the weather in the morning and use the number corresponding to the weather as the encryption key. The messengers carry the encrypted orders, but they do not know what the orders are and do not know how to decrypt them. After a few months, Caesar finds that the enemies can easily understand most messages that they capture.

</p> <p> Question:  Choose the option that best describes how Caesar's enemies are able to understand the messages.</p>
