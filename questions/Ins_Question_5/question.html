<p>Scenario:  John is a talent agent for famous movie stars. He uses the Zircon instant messaging service to chat with his celebrity clients. Zircon has a strong and respected "end-to-end" encryption design. In other words, data is encrypted on the sender's phone, is encrypted all the way from the sender to the receiver, and is only decrypted once it reaches the Zircon app on the receiver's phone. Furthermore, Zircon never stores any user information on its servers. One day, the gossip magazine HottGoss publishes exclusive information about John's clients.

</p> <p> Question:  What is the most likely way that the magazine got the information, even though Zircon has a strong cryptographic design?</p>
