<p>Scenario:  Abigail and Natalie are CS students writing a program together as part of a "pair programming" assignment where each of them implements two different sorting functions. After a morning of programming, Abigail spent a couple of hours proofreading her part of the program, finding and fixing several bugs. Later, Natalie sends her code to Abigail, who combines the two parts of the program. When Abigail and Natalie run the full program, there are many errors.
