<p>Scenario:  Sensor number 42 at a nuclear reactor needs to send confidential values over an unreliable and insecure wireless network to a server for analysis to keep the reactor working safely. Messages are frequently corrupted due to radiation, interference, and other reasons. Values generated by the sensor are uniformly distributed 128-bit values (i.e., they are equally likely to be any number between 0 and (2<sup>128</sup>)-1). To ensure the confidentiality of the data and protect against corruption, each value generated by the sensor is individually encrypted using a strong symmetric cipher with a block size of 128 bits and a random 128-bit encryption key that was permanently written into the sensor and shared with the analysis server at install time. The encrypted message is then sent over the network.
