<p>Scenario:  “Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) route network traffic between computers using a software “tunnel”. They are often used to hide the origin of the traffic by routing it through computers unrelated to the sender. A criminal on the east coast of the US uses the commercial VPN Tesseract (the world's most advanced VPN) to route their Internet traffic through computers on the west coast of the US while they commit crimes. However, the criminal is caught and arrested by the FBI.

</p> <p> Question:  Which of the following is the most likely way that the authorities could have caught the criminal, even though the criminal used an advanced VPN?</p>
