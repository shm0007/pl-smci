<p>Scenario:  In 2002, the US Government selected AES to be its standard encryption algorithm after a design contest and extensive review process. While learning about cryptography as a student, Alice spent some time experimenting with the source code of AES. Discovering that AES ran 10 times faster if she changed a certain variable's value, Alice shared this information with the government as a potential performance improvement. The government rejected the change.

</p> <p> Question:  What is the most likely reason that the government rejected this change, even though it improves encryption performance by a factor of 10?</p>
