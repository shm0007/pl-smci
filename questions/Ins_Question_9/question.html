<p>Scenario:  Your friend developed a revolutionary new kind of social network. They rent a server in a datacenter to host the public website. However, not trusting another company to store their users' data, they installed a high-bandwidth link in their house and run both the database and backup servers in their basement. Your friend carefully configured the database server to communicate with the website securely, including validating and sanitizing all data, and configured the backup server to make a copy of the database once per day. They apply all security updates to all servers as soon as they are available.

</p> <p> Question:  What is the most likely way that an attacker could successfully steal the data on the backend server?</p>
