<p>Scenario:  In a parallel universe, superheroes exist and they use an exclusive Superhero-only social media site called "SuperBook." SuperBook is developed by CompuBrain, a hero whose superpower is to write perfectly secure code. Certified heroes can friend each other and share their thoughts in real-time on SuperBook (e.g. the movies they liked, the books they hated, places they found peace, photos of their favorite meals, vacation photos, and so on). Even though they sometimes make posts while in their personal lives, the heroes are careful to never include photos of themselves while in their secret identities. Everyone else (villains and mortals) can view the public SuperBook, but, to maintain the anonymity of the beloved heroes, the public SuperBook hides the secret identities, photos marked as super-only, and GPS data of heroes from non-heroes, additionally, all traffic to and from SuperBook uses a widely-used open-source end-to-end encryption. Nevertheless, one day, supervillain Dr. Malware reveals the secret identity of CompuBrain to the world.
