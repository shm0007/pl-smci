<p>Scenario:  AJ is an accountant at SodaBank, but faces termination because they have two unauthorized wire transfers on their record. The first transfer happened years ago; at the time, AJ claimed they made a typo and entered account number 9909009 instead of 9909099. The transfer was reversed and AJ was allowed to stay. The second wire transfer happened just moments ago. When questioned, AJ told the authorities that he got a phone call from the CEO requesting an immediate wire transfer to a new bank account as required by a highly time-sensitive business deal. The alleged phone call took place while the anti-malware system and firewalls were being updated. The CEO claimed that they never made such a phone call to AJ, while AJ argued that they would never steal money from the company because, as the accountant, they would obviously get caught.

</p> <p> Question:  What is most likely to have really happened in this scenario.</p>
