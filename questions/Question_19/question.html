<p>Scenario:  You are a developer for Pizza++, a new online-only pizza delivery company. The previous developer had created a "shopping cart" system where people could create and customize orders. You've added a "purchase" component showing the price of the items in the cart, the applicable tax, and a text entry field allowing the user to add a numeric amount to tip the driver. The tip is added directly to the other costs to produce a total amount owed. A payment processing company handles charging credits cards.

</p> <p> Question:  Which of the following is the most likely potential flaw in the system?</p>
