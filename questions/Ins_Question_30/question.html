<p>Scenario:  Dylan created an account on a new and experimental website created by one of their friends. Since they don't expect to use to this website often, they decide to make their login info easy to remember by basing it on another password they have memorized. They create a password for the new website by taking their FaceSpace social networking site password, "K73_Sprinkles!1!", and add one to the last digit to create the password "K73_Sprinkles!2!". Soon, Dylan finds that their FaceSpace account has been hacked and their password changed.
