<p>Scenario:  April is a college undergraduate who has created her own blogging system to allow users to log on via the Internet and write text posts. The site communicates using a standard encrypted web connection. A user's posts are stored as text files in a folder named after their username, with a filename that matches the title of the post. Within the user folder is also a file called _password.txt containing their password, used by the blog software during authentication. Once logged on they could make new posts. Anyone can view old posts by entering the name of the old post.

The figure below the question shows the file layout. One day, April noticed a new post in her directory (dnd_is_boring.txt). She is certain that she did not make that post.

</p> <p> Question:  Which of the following is the most likely way that this could have happened.</p>
