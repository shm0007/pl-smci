<p>Scenario:  April is a college undergraduate who has created her own blogging system to allow users to log on via the Internet and write text posts. The site communicates using a standard encrypted web connection. A user's posts are stored as text files in a folder named after their username, with a filename that matches the title of the post. Within the users' folder is also a file called _password.txt containing their password, used by the blog software during authentication. They can make new posts once they are logged in. Anyone can view old posts by entering the name of the old post.The figure below the question shows the file layout.</p>
