<p>Scenario:  Jack runs IT for a company that stores all of its data in a large database. All connections to the server are encrypted using a common encryption algorithm and a firewall is used to only allow in authorized traffic. There are two permission groups on the database server: The default group, Management, is for employees such as Jack who need access to the entire system. The second group, Employees, is for employees who only need access to non-sensitive information. A new employee named Ellie is hired, but she stopped showing up after a week. Later, it was revealed that Ellie stole a large sum of money from the company and left the country.
