<p>Scenario:  Several "student records" computers were set up around campus in public places so that any student could log into one and access their course registration and other information. To ensure the students' privacy, students were required to use strong passwords and could only access their own information. Non-students were not allowed to log in. The computers were bolted to the floor and their cases were locked so that they couldn't be opened or moved. The computers were configured to only talk to the records computers in the campus IT department, and used Ethernet cable network connections to nearby wall jacks instead of wireless networking. One day, a large amount of confidential student data was leaked online.
