<p>Scenario:  Max has many online accounts. Max wants to be very secure, so they create a random 64-character password containing many upper- and lower-case letters, many numbers, and many special characters (e.g., !, @, #, ?, etc.). No characters repeat adjacent to each other (e.g., "aa"), and no special character is used more than once. Max then memorizes and uses this very strong password for all their online accounts.

</p> <p> Question:  Choose the option that describes the most significant security problem with this approach.</p>
