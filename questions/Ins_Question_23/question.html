<p>Scenario:  Jack and Jill are two random users of the Connectie social networking app. Connectie is developing a recommendation engine that can give incredibly accurate search and product recommendations based on a user's specific interests but requires data mining of extensive personal information and data collected about that particular user by the Connectie smartphone app. Connectie makes the feature available,  but they give users a chance to opt out of the data mining (and the feature). Jack opts out of the new feature, while Jill accepts the feature. Soon, Jill starts receiving the high-quality personalized recommendations. Strangely, Jack also starts getting personalized recommendations that are very relevant to his interests.

</p> <p> Question:  Choose the option that best explains how Jack could be getting the high-quality recommendations, even though he opted out.</p>
