<p>Scenario:  Jack and Jill are two random users of the Connectie social networking app. Connectie is developing a recommendation engine that can give incredibly accurate recommendations based on a user's specific interests   but requires extensive personal information about that particular user. Connectie adds a new feature where they mine the personal/sensitive data from the Connectie app in exchange for advanced personalized recommendations, but they give users a chance to opt out. Jack opts out of the new feature. Jill starts receiving the high-quality personalized recommendations. Strangely, Jack also starts getting personalized recommendations that are very relevant to his interests.

</p> <p> Question:  Choose the option that best explains how Jack could be getting the high-quality recommendations, even though he opted out.</p>
