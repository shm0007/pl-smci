As part of NSF grant #1821788, we (Dr. Peterson and students in the Laboratory for Advanced Research in Systems at UMD) are creating a test to measure students' understanding of basic computer security concepts. As part of this development, we want to know what students believe about these concepts, or what their instinct or common sense tells them is the right answer.

This activity is a survey asking for your answers to multiple-choice security questions. You are only graded on participation.

It is important that you NOT use any books, friends, or online resources to answer these questions -- we want to know what you know without any outside information, and you will not be graded on the correctness of your answers in any way. If you don't know the answer, make up something that sounds plausible to you.

Please treat the content of this survey as confidential and do not share it online.
